<h1>Plan Picker Home</h1>
<p>Welcome to <em>PlanPicker</em>, a very basic Django web app developed
to help you pick your plans when the burden of too many options becomes too much</p>

<h3>Plan Picker has the following record counts: </h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Plans:</strong> {{ num_plans }}</li>
        <li><strong>Locations:</strong> {{ num_locs }}</li>
    </ul>
